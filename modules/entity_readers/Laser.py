	Laser (0x19 = 25) 10000100
	11 entities, obviously.
	Node structure:
	- node_flags is always 20060005, except for the monastery, for which it is 20860005.
	- node_string is always provided and gives the name of the area.
	- node_group_id is different for each laser.
	- node_ids is only provided for spec_ruin, which is attached to Door-284.
	- node_float is never provided (-1.0).
	- node_ints is always ([], [0]), except for spec_ruin, for which is is (Door-284, [0, 1]), as its mesh lighting depend on whether it's still underground or at the surface.
	- node_final_floats is always (3.8612, -0.0148, 0.0, 3.0195).
