def read_Lake(f):
	'''
	Lake (0x17 = 23) 01111101
	78 entities: Water planes.
	Node structure:
	- node_flags â€¦
	- node_string is only provided for #12 (hardSecret_water), 20 (moving_water_level), and 60 (:OCEAN_REFL_Z_DONT_DELETE).
	- node_ids can point to a Door entity -> Because the state of the Statue depends on the openning of doors in the mountain, and clams for vault doors?
	- the ids in node_ints can be ids of Door entities
	- node_float is never provided (-1.0).
	- all Lake entities have a list of ints in node_ints.
	- node_final_floats depend on the presence of grid cordinates in field 6.

	This seems to be an editor-only entity, which is always used to generate a save_{entity_id}.mesh file.
	The mesh is a simple rectangle for the non-sea lakes, but for sea lakes the mesh contains 7 geometries, one for each level of detail from 0 to 6 included, with 2^(6-LOD) subdivisions of the geometry.
	In some sea lakes, the mesh is roughly cut along some simple polygonal shape (the same at all LODs), although nothing in the Lake entity data seems to match this shape. For instance, in #252276, we see the shape of the Hub's dock.
